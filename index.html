                    <p>The process of teaching AI models to analyse data and come to wise judgements is known as machine learning. On the other hand, machine unlearning, although not a term with official definition, refers to the process of changing or removing
                        learned information from AI systems. This idea is figurative and refers to situations where the model needs to be updated with appropriate and impartial data in order to adjust to changing data patterns, ensure privacy compliance,
                        or correct biases. Machine Unlearning, albeit not precisely defined, refers to the adaptation of AI models to preserve compliance, justice, and accuracy in the face of changing demands.</p>

                            <p>NIST accepted the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a symmetric-key block cipher that IBM developed in the early 1970s. Using a 56-bit key and 64-bit plaintext blocks, it employs 16 rounds of encryption based on the Feistel structure.
                                Although DES was widely used, its lower key size made it more susceptible to increases in processing power, leading to its replacement by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The first permutation, key transformation,
                                expansion permutation, S-Box and P-Box permutations, and XOR operations are the essential steps in the algorithm. Different versions of DES, such as ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, and CTR, are available for varying encryption algorithms.
                                Triple DES (3DES), which encrypts data three times using distinct keys, endures as a legacy system even though DES is no longer the industry standard due to security concerns. Still, even 3DES is slated for discontinuation
                                by NIST from 2024.</p>
